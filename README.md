# TAG
Datapack and Map for TAG game in Minecraft: Java Edition, version 1.21.4

## Installing
### Essential Client (recommended)
This mod is compatible with Essential Client (recommended for multiplayer convenience). Download the installer from *https://essential.gg/en* and follow the installation wizard prompts to add a **1.21.4** Essential instance to the default launcher (**any other version of Minecraft will not work**). You can also download the Essential mod directly from Modrinth (https://modrinth.com/mod/essential/versions?g=1.21.4) and add it to 1.21.4 Fabric instance.
### Setting up the world
Step 1: Navigate to the latest release and download the folder titled "TAG - Map". Extract this folder and add it to your saves folder (for default launcher, this will likely be under C:\Users\[your namespace]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves). Alternatively, download and extract the folder titled "TAG - Datapack". Create a new world with the "Allow Commands" setting enabled and add this folder into the datapacks section of the menu. 
Step 2: Once loaded into the world, type "/reload" to reload the datapack.
Note: The game may prompt a warning when attempting to join the world due to the incorporation of experimental features in the map/datapack. Just select "Yes" to proceed.
### Invite friends
Once the game loads, add friends through the social tab and invite them to the TAG world.
### Starting the game
Configure settings with the buttons around the lobby. These include changing the map, changing the duration of a round, and enabling the glowing effect for the runners, taggers, both or neither. The game will automatically start when all players are standing in either the tagger or runner cell (see below).

## Troubleshooting
Type "/reload" to reload the datapack for troubleshooting, especially on loading into the world. If the issue persists, ensure you have the correct version of Minecraft installed, or DM me on discord - @parafraser.
